    "\n",
    "When you open a Jupyter notebook, it launches a process in the background called a **kernel**, which executes code sent by the user and communicates the results back to the notebook interface in the browser. Python-based Jupyter notebooks use an [IPython kernel](https://ipython.org/), which provides many handy features for interactive coding, such as auto-complete, object introspection, magic commands, and more. Jupyter notebooks also support R, Julia, Perl, and over 100 other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input/output history labels to the left of each code cell (e.g., `In[3]`, `Out[3]`) give you information about the history of cell execution for your current kernel session. If there is no number inside the square brackets, the code cell has not yet been run. If there is a number inside the square brackets, it tells you the order of execution of this cell during the current kernel session (the kernel session has a counter that increments by one each time you execute a cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can restart a kernel session, which clears out all the variables and imported libraries, while maintaining the output of all the code cells. In addition to running cells one at a time, you can select several cells and run them in order, or run all the notebook's cells, from start to end. These options are available in the Kernel menu and the Run menu\n",
    "\n",
    "From the **Top Menu**, try each of the following:\n",
    "- Select Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs. You'll see all the code output disappears, the input/output history labels are empty (`In[]`, `Out[]`), and the previously defined variables and imported libraries are no longer available.\n",
    "- Select Run $\\rightarrow$ Run All Cells to run all the cells, from top to bottom.\n",
    "- Select Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart Kernel. You'll see that the code output remains, but previously defined variables and imported libraries are no longer available.\n",
    "- Experiment with other options from the Run menu and the Kernel menu, such as running several selected cells, or running all cells above/below a selected cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Since notebooks are nonlinear, as mentioned in the previous section, and cells can be run multiple times and out of order, you'll find that as you work on your notebook, the numbers in the `In[]`, `Out[]` labels are often not in order. Try running the cell below a few times in a row and see that the number increments by one each time. Then try running the three cells below, in different orders, to see how the numbers change."
